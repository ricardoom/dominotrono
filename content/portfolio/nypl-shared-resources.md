      The NYPL Shared Collection is an interface to search the catalogs of NYPL, Columbia and Princeton Universities. The system is designed to decrease friction between sharing items across institutions. While this project had seen many iterations, I was responsible for the most recent one. My primary objective was to increase the readability and ensure our accessibility standards were met.

      Much of our research indicated that our users would access the application from a variety of devices. All of the application's various states and layouts are composed from components described by the <a href="/portfolio/nypl-design-toolkit">NYPL Design Toolkit</a>

         In order to ensure each page rendered correctly we opted to use system fonts instead of the custom NYPL typeface. An additional benefit would be that we would not be overtaxing our user's devices or data plans. In the cases where we do use a custom type face we restricted the amount of characters to the upper and lower case Roman alphabet with the knowledge that we would not need punctuation, numerals or other special characters.
