Hi!, Thanks for taking the time to review my application and considering me for the UI / UX position at Friendbuy.com. Below are a few projects I've completed over past few years I believe are relevant to the position.

## NYPL Staff Picks & Best Books

    {{< copy_wrapper
      class="hero-grid__copyBlock" >}}
      We created the Best Books app to highlight the expertise and extensive breadth of knowledge held by the librarians working at NYPL. We built an interactive tool allowing users to discover new recommendations from our expert staff.

## NYPL Design Toolkit

{{< section_wrapper class="hero-grid" >}}

      {{< image_cld
        class="hero-grid__imageBlock"
        
        data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/toupeeproofbullets/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_960/ar_16:9,c_crop,g_north/v1549729406/nypl-design-toolkit/dtk-color-table"

    {{< copy_wrapper class="hero-grid__copyBlock">}}
      The Design Toolkit at NYPL was our online style-guide and foundation for a more extensive design system. We wanted to free the front end developers up from having to make design decisions and create an opportunity to develop reusable components and styles. We also needed to have robust documentation and code examples.

## SimplyE Audio Books

{{< section_wrapper class="hero-grid" >}}

    {{< image_cld
    class="hero-grid__imageBlock"
    data-src="https://res.cloudinary.com/toupeeproofbullets/image/upload/q_auto,w_auto,c_scale,f_auto/v1582837490/simply-e/se-screens-view-ios.jpg"
    
    alt="An image of the iOS user flow screens"
    >}}
    {{< copy_wrapper class="hero-grid__copyBlock">}}
    My role was to create a user interface for audio-book playback and to create new pathways for discovery. I was tasked with creating a brand cohesive aesthetic as well as user flow definition. A major responsibility was to describe all the various states, from granular user setting controls to error messages and pathways.

        {{< copy_wrapper class="hero-grid__copyBlock" >}}
          Seattle based Chef Mike Easton approached me to design and develop the website for his new restaurant concept Il Nido. No longer interested in maintaining a blog, we decided to close down his WordPress site and go with a simple brochure-style single-page site.
