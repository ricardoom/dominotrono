But CSS is still my first love (as far as web design goes.) I was there when creating 960px grid layouts were all the rage. And "float rage" was real. Now its easy to just set up a grid or a flex and we can get down the real business of arguing over whether or not HTML is a programming language...(it is).

While working as a freelance designer working w/ CSS and Sass are my bread and butter. I authored all the CSS on this site. For better or worse. Below are number of projects that show case my skill with CSS.

      For simplicity sake and to avoid needless content shift, I opted for to use system fonts. I often rely on a stack composed of the major sets of system fonts found on across the most popular devices. By doing this we provide a very reliable and familiar experience. User's will see their own system's fonts in use and they will not experience FOUC (Flash of Un-styled Content.) Additionally by not adding another request, often to a different source for type faces, the content loads faster and we save our user's time and bandwidth.

      The Design Toolkit at NYPL was our online style-guide and foundation for a more extensive design system. We wanted to free the front end developers up from having to make design decisions and create an opportunity to develop reusable components and styles. We also needed to have robust documentation and code examples.
