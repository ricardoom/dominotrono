     The following examples highlight a cross-section of my web and app design experience. My work at Pearson demonstrates my ability to work within a large organization as an individual contributor to a dedicated product team. For the Native Bound Unbound project, I excelled by guiding the director through design and engineering decisions as well as completing the initial design system. During my tenure at the New York Public Library, I served as the senior staff designer and oversaw all visual and user experience design efforts for the digital team.

      Most of my work at Pearson centered around an internal eText authoring environment called "Bronte." As a result, the user experience work focused specifically on the publishing workflow and administration.

      The publishing workflow was tedious and time-consuming, compelling the author to navigate to two separate parts of the tool's project management interface to publish the work to Pearson's eText management ecosystem and beyond to their public marketplace.

        My proposed solution was to bring the publishing process into the project management interface activated via a kebab menu interaction alongside other available actions on the file.

      As a general rule, we created specification sheets for all proposed components. We needed to outline specifically where there are state changes, subsequent animations, etc.

      Curriculex seeks to replace traditional textbook learning with interactive and engaging lessons. For an instructor, managing course and group work can be challenging. From a student's perspective, reading through long tracts of dense text is neither tenable nor provides the necessary background and foundation for real-world nursing situations.

        While at the New York Public Library, I was responsible for overseeing and executing a large redesign of the library's website. Aside from top-level pages and interactions, I was instrumental in the design and implementation of new features. These included new search interfaces for new arrivals, a discovery interface for research materials as well as new features and redesigned UI for SimplyE, an open-source application and eReader platform.

      We conducted an extensive survey of nypl.org and all of our internal tools, micro-sites, and applications for proper WCAG 2.0 Compliance. With the understanding that the Design Toolkit will need to inform and influence all projects going forward. For structure and style to be fully accessible by default, all components included in the Design Tool Kit would have their accessibility rules baked into their design patterns.
