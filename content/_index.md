Hello! I am a UX Engineer or Design Engineer or... Full Stack Designer(?). All of those things? All of those things! Over the last twenty odd years, I have worked on everything from Flash interactive sites to iOS video streaming apps. I am very interested in unusual interfaces, animation, CSS, and all things SVG, as well as learning the dark arts of Javascript. You will find a strong commitment to designing and implementing accessible interfaces. I am dedicated to doing an excellent paint job on the hood. That said, obsessing about what is going on underneath the hood is an obsession of mine. Being the kind of person who wants to know how the clock ticks makes my clock tick...
