Like it says upstairs, my wheelhouse has been mostly on HTML / CSS / Design side of things and so I'm still pretty novice when it comes to JS. That said, I know more than I did two years ago. Which is saying a lot! Ha. Anyway, I'm really inspired by what people do in the creative / generative world with JavaScript. These works below showcase some of my efforts using public APIs to use as seed data. Or in another case query an open source image service to use in generative collage.

I'll also add links to the respective github repos at the bottom of this page(anchor link to bottom of page)
