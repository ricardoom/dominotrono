The idea here is to briefly jot down activities, changes, inquiries, research topics etc, so as to better document and gauge progress on this site specifically and growth as a artist, designer and developer in general.

So... um yeah. havent done anything lately! as of late.... blergh. So here we go. I've been gardening. Raising the kids. Moved to LA. I also need to fix a bunch of stuff on this website!

### 12-1-2020

Moving this log to individual posts... makes more sense. See you on the other side.

### 3-17-2020

Crazy times. Corona virus has the world paralyzed. For my family's part, we're scared and resolute. Frustrated and yet despite all the ~~winning~~ failing, hopeful.

### 3-16-2020

Been working on a pure JS matching game. I'll admit its been stalled for a couple weeks... desultory prodding but nothing serious to take the next step. With no end in sight I have been thinking about state, and how my problems with the my little matching app are about state, so I looked into to doing some simple pure JS state study.

Determined to be a better developer, despite some who question the effort. It is hard to show results when your audience is less than sympathetic and easily baffled, confused and put off by concepts or technology outside of their ken.

I've creaed a collage maker and am working on a matching / memory game. The collage maker will soon be added to this site in form of portfolio page and the matching game is still in early development so it will eventually find its way here, but not for a while

Yeah, went on hiatus in a big way. Swore off web design several times. But the reality is, I dont have many other prosepects. So I've come to terms w/ a few things; Imposter syndrome, fear and loathing of office life. I need to have creative control and outlets. Employment that is purely transactional, is not the way I want to live. I will also start modifying this site design to showcase more of my fine art and other design endeavors and interests. Today I am kicking off the new Notch 2.0 project. Basically getting reacquainted w/ Shopify, Liquid and Sketch. I will also be doing a revamp of my web project page(s) into a more coherent case study format, starting with the Notch project.

### 3-12-2019

So, the idea was to do this little journal entry every day... So today, I fixed up a bunch of portfolio pages, finalized the social media icons using `<use>` and `<svg>`. Want to circle back w/ hugo params or data so this can be a loop instead of hard coded, works nicely though. Fixed some other radom things as well. And lastly, I need to catch up w/ my #100DaysOfCode project.

### 3-1-2019

Went down a PostCSS rabbit hole...And then thought better of it, and started setting up a new domain. Added the skills section to the home page. TODO: make some nice graphics design for each set...

### 2-28-2019

More work on the mobile nav. Needed styling. TODO: Close on click _outside_ of nav area...ðŸ¤”

### 2-27-2019

Added a very basic mobile nav to the site. Needs accessibility testing.

### 2-26-2019

Using FontFaceObserver to bring nicer fonts, was getting a bit tired of the system fonts, and as a designer we want the snazz. So snazz was brought, with help from Adobe Typekit, as I did not want to use the other service that shall not be named.

### 2-20-2019

2 hours work on JS tutorials, then a good chunk of the day was spent futzing w/ an animation idea, that still needs work.

### 2-19-2019

Admin stuff around the casa. Mostly opening mail, rearranging piles of paper work and bills paid. Woo. Some code, but nothing substantial.

### 2-18-2019

Did some work on that old coffee maker project. Set up Go on my computers.

### 2-17-2019

Working w/ SQIB: https://github.com/technopagan/sqip on my way to implementing something w/ `intersectionObserver`.
Rewrote the masthead... too.
