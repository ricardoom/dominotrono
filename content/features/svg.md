I built an icon library for NYPL, and have strongly advocated for their use across any number of projects I've worked on. SVG is rich with complexity and capability. The whole front page of this site is one giant SVG or rather a few of them composed together.

I hope to do more work in this field in the very near future. Below are a few items showcasing my work with this great technology

- show those kooky interfaces

- the collage maker

- using for Il Nido's logos on the home page

  - maybe a bit about how they work vis-a-vis a browser
