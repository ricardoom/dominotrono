This little experiment is designed to get some animation on the page, basically floating dots of various size, shape and speed to create some horizontal motion. Ultimately this technique will be used on the home page, but I need a simple environment to test it out...

BEHOLD!

Now this is getting a little tricky. So one of the more challenging things here is getting each circle object to have it's own animation.
