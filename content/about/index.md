{{< resume >}}

I started my design career in the 5th grade by entering and winning a “crazy t-shirt” contest. My love for typography stems from being a graffiti writer and painting murals in New York and Philadelphia. However, my passion for art and design spans many years. From punk rock show fliers produced at Kinko’s with X-Acto knives, glue sticks, and Xerox machines through skateboard graphics through my training as an offset printing press operator, I’ve always been an artist and designer. Early in my career I spent time working in kitchens and honing my chops as journeyman designer. Of late, my personal life centers around freelance projects and caring for my kids. 

I am highly proficient with Figma, Adobe CC, and Sketch. In the last 5 years, I’ve become comfortable working with command-line tools such as git, npm, and other graphics production-related tasks. I have been on an intense, self-directed JavaScript journey. This site has been handcrafted and coded with CSS Grids, Sass, and JavaScript. I manage the content via the static site generator Hugo.

In the summer of 2021 we moved our family to California to be closer to family. I am learning Brazilian Jiujitsu and am an avid gardener. Occasionally, I dust off my skateboard, make turns, and draw arcs through space and time.
