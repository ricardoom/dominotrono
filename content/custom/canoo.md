     I created this web page to highlight my expertise and demonstrate my qualifications for the Senior UI UX Designer at Canoo. The following examples highlight my experience in Interface and UX design. My work at Pearson demonstrates my ability to work within a large organization as an individual contributor to a dedicated product team. For the Native Bound Unbound project, I excelled by guiding the director through design and engineering decisions as well as completing the initial design system. During my tenure at the New York Public Library, I served as the senior staff designer and oversaw a variety of administrative and end-user interface design efforts.

      Most of my work at Pearson centered around an internal eText authoring environment called "Bronte." As a result, the user experience work focused specifically on the publishing workflow and administration.

      The publishing workflow was tedious and time-consuming, compelling the author to navigate to two separate parts of the tool's project management interface to publish the work to Pearson's eText management ecosystem and beyond to their public marketplace.{{< /copy_wrapper>}}
      {{< copy_wrapper
        class="details-grid__twoByTwo copy-block__left" >}}
        My recommendation was to bring the publishing workflow into the management overview screen and embed the publishing functions, activating a kebab menu item and visually indicating the state and status of a given document.

      As a general rule, we created specification sheets for all proposed components. We were required to outline specifically all states, where they changed, and any subsequent animations. Because Pearson has very strict Accessibility protocols, all new proposals are required to pass through an A11y audit. New features were required to have each possible state specified and in alignment with Bronte's design system.

      Curriculex seeks to disrupt traditional textbook learning with engaging interactive lessons and a live instructional platform for both in-person and remote classrooms. My work focused on the instructor's experience; covering both class and learning asset/content management, while other team members focused on the student experience. For an instructor, managing course and group work can be challenging. I focused primarily on reducing friction between understanding a student's progress overall and acting upon incoming data in real time.

      During our discovery phase, we sought to break down so-called learning pathways into modular course units with coursework designed to be consumed and completed before, during and after class. Much of my explorations encircled the experience related to "during class" group work. Much of this encapsulation was expressed as low to high-fidelity analytics dashboards.

    My initial investigations began by working with the logo designer's color recommendations. I built out the color set and expanded the possible use cases for the logos. The color themes inherent to the logos were helpful, but I needed to create a more versatile and sturdy design system. To do this, I had to broaden the range of colors and typography to accommodate different scenarios. We needed to account for body copy, several different headline levels, and various potential typographic contexts.

      I began the design process by determining the typefaces and scale needed to achieve a visually pleasing composition. I utilized an online tool called utopia.xyz. That tool allows you to choose a scalar, upper and lower bounds (largest & smallest) and it will produce a set of scale rules allowing the designer to create a scalable type and layout system. This system takes advantage of the browser's capabilities to render a page back to the viewer at the right size for their screen without the need for breakpoints.

      The fundamental aspect of the typographic work centers around headline and body copy type styles. All other forms are derived from these two core design artifacts. The reasoning behind this methodology is to sustain a very low level of design complexity. In my Figma, Sass and HTML I can easily modify these core elements and rely on cascading to effect all the descendant styles and layouts.

      Following the essential and more fundamental elements are components derived by compositing together the core elements. These tend towards more complex arrangements; again, the essential nature of these elements is their relationship to their origins within the ecosystem. Of primary importance is navigation. For both small and large screens, I devised a simple and flexible solution where designers or engineers could easily add any number of navigation items.

      We conducted an extensive survey of nypl.org and all of our internal tools, micro-sites, and applications for proper WCAG 2.0 Compliance. With the understanding that the Design Toolkit will need to inform and influence all projects going forward. For structure and style to be fully accessible by default, all components included in the Design Tool Kit would have their accessibility rules baked into their design patterns.

       We paid close attention to getting our forms correct. Assigning the exact ARIA attributes and states was key to our implementation.

        As we progressed on our iOS version of the app, we also began creating the Android corollary designs and flows. While this was relatively trivial, Android OSes have different controls causing some minor divergence in how we considered our users and their expectations. The team decided to utilize as much of the Material design system as possible, mirroring the same attitude we held for our iOS version.
