Design is the core of my work. I have been working in some capcity as a designer for my entire adult life. At some point I will dig into the crates and give examples of my work from as far back as I can reach. For now the works below function as a companion and overview of my main portfolio. But in no particular order

- JS experiments

- DCNM 

- Il Nido

- Mama San

- Diorama

- NPL

- Nasa posters
