## What do you need gulp.js for anyway?

The whole point is to learn a few things, where to start? I suppose with fundamentals. I've been avoiding JS for years. It was in the early 2000's when I came across a JS book and I did some examples and ran through the chapters. None of it stuck. I blamed it on poor writing and inadequate documentation. Really, though, I couldn't grok some of the concepts and gave up.

Over the years I've made desultory attempts at learning the language but never really put in the time or effort.

What I'm aiming to accomplish with this new iteration of bullet proof toupee is manifold, but one of the core goals is to master javascript such that it becomes a tool in my creative arsenal.

* using JS to create motion
  * ````svg```` &amp; ````css````
* using JS to better spin up prototypes
* using JS to create dynamic layouts
* using JS to manipulate objects and devices via Arudino (or some such)

So tonight I was able to get Gulp going on this project to compile my `sass`. Not the biggest achievement by any stretch, but getting it running on a very basic level scratched an itch.
