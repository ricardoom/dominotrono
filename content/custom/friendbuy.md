Hi!, Thanks for taking the time to review my application and considering me for the UI / UX position at Friendbuy.com. Below are a few projects I've completed over past few years I believe are relevant to the position.

## NYPL Best Books

We created the Best Books app to highlight the expertise and extensive breadth of knowledge held by the librarians working at NYPL. We built an interactive tool allowing users to discover what the librarians were reading and recommend to their patrons.

      One of the challenges faced was building a website application that could reliably function without JavaScript. Additionally, the app must be fully operable by keyboard or assertive technology.
