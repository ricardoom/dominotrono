          Decolonizing New Mexico is meant to enter gather historical context and ideas toward the development of a process, centering truth and transformation in New Mexico. The project is designed with flexibility for growth and expansion as new material created and added. I designed the entire project to be as lean as possible. The design and prototype work was executed in Adobe XD, the site is built with Hugo. For hosting, we use Netlify hosting / deployment and Forestry as the CMS for easy and very intuitive content management.

      For full disclosure Dr. Rael–Gálvez and I are first cousins. The project grew out of an informal consulting relationship when Dr. Rael–Gálvez contacted me for advice on how he should go about creating and publishing his paper <i>"Decolonizing New Mexico"</i> to his website. Rather than bury this timely and important piece in PDF form there, I suggested we create a website. As a result this project we collaborated to create this project. It gave me valuable insight and experience working with Hugo, Netlify, Forestry and modern CSS, HTML and JavaScript, as well as ancillary technologies like git, and bash scripting.

      This project was also a first for me due to the fact that all the layout and design work was executed with Adobe XD. While initally I felt hampered by the unfamiliar interface, overall I think its a fine product and will use it again.

      For simplicty sake and to avoid needless content shift, I opted for to use system fonts. I often rely on a stack composed of the major sets of system fonts found on across the most popular devices. By doing this we provide a very reliable and familiar experience. User's will see their own system's fonts in use and they will not experience FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content.) Additionally by not adding another request, often to a different source for type faces, the content loads faster and we save our user's time and bandwidth.

      This project was fun due the fact that I was able to make liberal and effective use of flexbox and grid. The main page layout is achieved with CSS Grid while the internal layouts are using flex. This made it much easier to get consistent vertical alignment and visual rhythm.

I am really liking Hugo for static site generation. Its super fast at the compilation phase and the community behind it is super helpful. It also has this kind of underdog vibe to it that I really identify with. Go Hugo! I will admit the syntax is a little hard to grok at first, but once you get on board, it flows pretty easily.

I have been making use of the Cloudinary API & next generation image formats on my projects of late and I really like how easy they make it to access your assets, and have them delivered to a person's device based on _their_ device's capabilities. It also makes for super good DX; with a little work upfront on the configuration side, later on its really easy to modify image format settings.

For this project I decided on using Netlify for hosting and Deployment. Its a really small code base of entirely static files so Netlify worked out great. We don't deploy that often, and when we do its really just updating markdown files from managed over in our Forestry.io instance, which again, with a little extra work upfront getting these two services to work together was a snap. I'm looking forward to more of it in the future.
